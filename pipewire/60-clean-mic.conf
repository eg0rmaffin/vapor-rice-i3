# DEPRECATED: Clean Mic is now managed by systemd service
#
# This file is kept for backwards compatibility but is EMPTY.
# The actual Clean Mic filter-chain is loaded by:
#
#   systemctl --user status pipewire-clean-mic.service
#
# This approach is MORE RELIABLE because:
#   1. context.modules drop-ins can fail SILENTLY on some PipeWire versions
#   2. Dedicated service has clear start/stop/status tracking
#   3. Errors are logged to journalctl (easier debugging)
#   4. Service dependencies ensure proper startup order
#
# Migration:
#   - The new config is at: ~/.config/pipewire/clean-mic-filter-chain.conf
#   - The service is at: ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-clean-mic.service
#   - Check status: clean-mic-status.sh
#
# If you're seeing this after an update:
#   Run install.sh again to get the new systemd-based approach.

# Empty configuration — Clean Mic is loaded by dedicated service now

# Keyboard backlight configuration
# Declarative brightness level cycling via standard Fn-keys
# Brightness levels are auto-detected based on hardware capabilities

# Standard XF86 keyboard backlight keys (Fn+Space / Fn+F5 etc. depending on laptop)
# Note: On many laptops, Fn+Space (XF86KbdLightOnOff) is handled entirely by firmware
# and never reaches X11. The systemd user service (kbd-backlight-watcher.service)
# monitors sysfs for brightness changes and shows OSD notifications regardless.
bindsym XF86KbdBrightnessUp exec --no-startup-id ~/dotfiles/bin/kbd-backlight.sh up
bindsym XF86KbdBrightnessDown exec --no-startup-id ~/dotfiles/bin/kbd-backlight.sh down
bindsym XF86KbdLightOnOff exec --no-startup-id ~/dotfiles/bin/kbd-backlight.sh notify

# The keyboard backlight watcher is now managed by systemd user service
# (kbd-backlight-watcher.service) instead of exec_always for better reliability
# and proper D-Bus environment inheritance. The service is enabled by install.sh.

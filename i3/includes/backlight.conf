# Screen backlight configuration
# Declarative brightness control with automatic hardware detection
#
# Supported hardware (auto-detected):
#   - AMD integrated graphics (primary) via amdgpu_bl* - works out of box
#   - Intel integrated graphics via intel_backlight - works out of box
#   - NVIDIA WMI EC (Lenovo Legion, etc.) via nvidia_wmi_ec_backlight
#   - Legacy ACPI systems via acpi_video*
#
# For AMD+NVIDIA hybrid with AMD as primary iGPU:
#   No configuration needed - amdgpu_bl* is used automatically
#
# For Intel+NVIDIA hybrid (some Lenovo Legion models):
#   May need kernel parameter: acpi_backlight=nvidia_wmi_ec
#   See nondeclarative/backlight-setup.md for details
